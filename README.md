# hello-world

Howdy creative people!

Linky here, I like Python, and currently I'm working with JS and PHP (but I'm getting ready to emigrate to Node JS).  
Although messing with programming, my real desire is to be a designer. Accurately a game designer. Especially a Visual and Experience Designer.

My dream is to stablish my indie game studio with my best partner Irony.  
We are lovers of Godot Game Engine, and brave enthusiasts of Indie Dev.
